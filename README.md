Youâ€™ll already have a README.md file in your GitHub containing the API you used. Expand on this README to include as much detail about your project as is possible and necessary.

a. README files are an essential piece of documentation to include in any project. They give anyone looking at your application or reading your code a reference for how it works.

the front end of this project is run from the 'client' directory with NPM START, and the backend is run from the server directory with NODEMON SERVER.JS

2. Please include the following details:
a. The title of your site and a link to the URL where it is deployed
    project title: Park Explorer Pro
    url: https://parkexplorerpro-client.herokuapp.com/
b. Describe what your website does
    Park Explorer Pro allows user many oprtions to access national parks data. 
c. List the features you implemented and explain why you chose those features to implement
    there are search options for many endpoints for the National Park api as well as guided search options in the form of of dynamic dropdowns as well as a map that displays all of the US national parks with popups. My core feature of the site are the pages for each specific park. each park has information, images, sunrise/sunset data, weather data, map data, campground data, and more.
d. Where your tests are and how to run them
    still need to come back to write tests
e. Walk someone through the standard user flow for the website
    the homepage has the most options for my site, these are several search bars that return results based on user input as well as options to return acticles, parks, things to do, visitor centers, tours. The main map page lists all parks and has pop-ups that give details as well as links to the full pages for each park.
f. Keep the API in there, and if you have anything to say about the API then add some notes. If you have created your own API, please document the process.
    This project uses 4 api. three of them are expernal (national parks, weather, and sunrise/sunset), the fourth is the backend api for my psql database.
g. Identify the technology stack used to create your website
